# Cool Trends, Tech, Companies and Industry things to monitor
List of tech / companies in different areas I'm watching or have liked the look of or just started to curate a list of

Over the last few years I have began lists of tech, industries, companies and things I want to watch or keep an eye on.
I thought I would put it on the internet, as I believe in sharing knowledge.

Yes one could perceive this as an awesome list of awesomeness, but that is not what I intended or setout to achieve.
If there is an awesome list for something usually I will link to it.
Yes I could have also made this into a tech radar, but I'm not looking to suggest to adopt any of these technologies or companies,
I am simply pointing people in a general direction or a starting point, if they wanted to look into an area more.

This is in no way an exhaustive list in each area. I don't have the time or mental breadth to keep up with each area. Some areas have been
a look into an area for an hour, some weeks, some months. If you think something should belong or not belong feel free to raise an issue or pull request.

Feel free to contribute :)
