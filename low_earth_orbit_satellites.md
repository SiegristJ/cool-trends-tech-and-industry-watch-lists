# Middle Earth Orbit 
- SES O3b constellation

Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to access the United States satellite market using 720 low-Earth orbit satellites — these satellites will utilize the Ka (20/30 GHz) and Ku (11/14
GHz) frequency bands to provide global Internet connectivity.

Traditional satellite internet companies have satellites at 36000 km

From 8,000 kilometers you can see about 50 degrees” north and south of the equator, Collar said. Others have said O3b is limited to more like 40 degrees either way.

“But as you get closer to the Earth and stay equatorial, your visibility reduces dramatically. That forces you into a much broader constellation with inclined planes and polar orbits. That adds huge complexity to the network. From our orbit, every one of our satellites is providing service permanently, with the exception of one, which is always performing [signal] handovers.

“In [low-Earth orbit], your efficiency drops from, say, 95 percent to maybe around 20 percent. So more and more of your satellites are spending more time over the poles, and others are spending more time handing over the signal from one satellite to the next. This has dramatic consequences for the number of satellites that you need.”
